	<h1>Time,Sapce and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time Complexity is a concept in computer science 
	that measures how the running time of an algorithm grows as the
		size of the input increases. Its a way to evaluate the whether the algorithm is efficient and compare their performance.</p>
	<p> <b>Space Complexity</b> evaluates the amount of memory an algorithm requires as the input size increases. Like Time Complexity, For example, an algorithm with a Space Complexity of O(n) uses memory proportional to the size of the input.</p>
