	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p><strong>Time complexity</strong> refers to how the running time of an algorithm scales with the size of its input. It is an essential measure of an algorithm's efficiency, helping developers assess which solution will work best for a given problem, especially for large datasets.</p>
    <p>Similarly, <strong>Space Complexity</strong> evaluates the amount of memory an algorithm requires as the input size grows. For example, an algorithm with a Space Complexity of <strong>O(n)</strong> uses memory proportional to the input size. Optimizing <strong>Space Complexity</strong> is vital to ensure that programs run efficiently without exceeding available memory resources.</p>
