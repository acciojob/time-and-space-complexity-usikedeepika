	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p><strong>Time complexity</strong> refers to how the running time of an algorithm scales with the size of its input. It is an essential measure that algorithm is efficient or not , helping developers assess which solution will work best for a given problem, especially for large datasets.</p>
    <p>Similarly, <b>Space Complexity</b> evaluates the amount of memory an algorithm requires as the input size grows. For example, an algorithm with a <b>Space Complexity</b> of uses memory proportional to the input size. Optimizing <b>Space Complexity</b> is vital to ensure that programs run efficiently without exceeding available memory resources.</p>
